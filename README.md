#srfn - Data Monitoring Tool

srfn is a Mixpanel data monitoring tool. The need emerged when we wanted to precisely monitor tracking events with a particular set of properties. No online dashboards offered the ability to filter on multiple properties.

##Setup

Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite)

##Running srfn

Clone this project, cd into it and then:

``` sh
$ mrt run
```
